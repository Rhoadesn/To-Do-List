# To-Do-List
User Friendly To-Do List. This application allows a user to Create, Edit, and Delete a To-Do list. 
Resources used: NetBeans, JavaFX scenebuilder. 

This is an in progress project that revolves around user convenience. Currently the user can create, edit, and delete a To-Do List.  
The user friendly aspects can be seen when the user loads, or deletes a file without a file-chooser interface. 
This allows the user to quickly load lists, and delete whatever list they need to.
Future updates will aim to make this application even more user friendly.
